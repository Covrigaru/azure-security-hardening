🚨 Customization Required Before Deployment:

What You Need to Customize:
Resource Group Names
Replace any generic resource group names (e.g., rg-template, example-rg) with the actual names used in your Azure subscription.

Location/Region
Ensure the region (e.g., eastus, westeurope) matches the geographic location where your resources should reside.

IP Addresses
Update placeholder IP ranges (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0, 10.0.0.0/24) with the correct, secure IP ranges needed for your environment.

Resource Names
Replace any generic names (e.g., vnet-name, vm-name, storage-name) with names that conform to your organization's naming convention and don't conflict with existing resources.

Subscription ID and Tenant ID
Confirm that the pipeline is targeting the correct subscription and tenant, especially in multi-subscription environments.

💡💡  Double-check all hardcoded values in ARM/Bicep templates or parameters files, and make sure you do not deploy using default values in a production environment.
